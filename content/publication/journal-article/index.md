abstract: More than 1.6 billion people worldwide live in informally constructed
  houses, many of which are reinforced with concrete. Patterns of past
  earthquake damage suggest that these homes have significant seismic
  vulnerabilities, endangering their occupants. The characteristics of these
  houses vary widely with local building practices. In addition, these
  vulnerabilities are potentially exacerbated by incremental construction
  practices and building practices that address wind/flood risk in multi-hazard
  environments. Yet, despite the ubiquity of this type of construction, there
  have not been efforts to systematically assess the seismic risks to support
  risk-reducing design and construction strategies. In this study, we developed
  a method to assess the seismic collapse capacity of informally constructed
  housing that accounts for local building practices and materials, quantifying
  the effect of building characteristics on collapse risk. We exercise the
  method to assess seismic performance of housing in the US. Caribbean Island of
  Puerto Rico, which has high seismic hazard and experiences frequent
  hurricanes. This analysis showed that heavy construction, often due to the
  addition of a second story, and the presence of an open ground story leads to
  a high collapse risk. Severely corroded steel bars could also worsen
  performance. Although houses with infill performed better than those with an
  open ground story, confined masonry construction techniques produced a major
  reduction in collapse risk when compared to infilled or open-frame
  construction. Infill construction with partial height walls performed very
  poorly. Well-built reinforced concrete column jackets and the addition of
  infill in open first-story bays can reduce the greater risks of
  open-ground-story houses. These findings, which are quantified in the results
  portion of this article, are intended to support the development of design and
  construction recommendations for safer housing.
