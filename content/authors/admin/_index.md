I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Alaska Anchorage, where I study the seismic risk of wood-frame structures and teach students the joys of MATLAB. I co-chair of EERI's Younger Members Committee. In 2021, I completed my PhD at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I studied the seismic performance of reinforced concrete structures as part of the Liel Research Group.
